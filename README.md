Restaurant Management System

A Restaurant is a business which prepares and serves food and drinks to customers.Customers can dine at a restaurant, order 
take out/delivery or sometimes even reserve tables ahead of time.The conventional way of satisfying these needs of customers 
is by having the waiters/waitress take food beverages orders which is usually done with pen and paper.This system can be very 
error prone from wrong interpretion of orders resulting in wrong orders being served, prevent in food being wasted.
These things are bad for business and can result in loss customers.
